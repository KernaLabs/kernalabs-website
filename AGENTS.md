# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The React sources live in `src/`, with `components/` for presentation, `hooks/` for reusable state, `utils/` for helpers, and `data/` for structured content. Shared configuration such as `imageManifest.json` is generated into `src/config/`. Static assets live in `public/`, and image variants are grouped under `public/images/` to align with the optimizer script. Node utilities reside in `scripts/`; avoid editing `build/` because it is regenerated by the build process.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `npm install` once to pull dependencies. Use `npm start` to launch the local dev server with hot reload. `npm run build` emits a production bundle into `build/`. When adding or changing imagery, prefer `npm run build:with-images`, which optimizes assets before compiling. `npm run optimize-images` can be called standalone, and `npm run deploy` publishes the latest `build/` directory to GitHub Pages via `gh-pages`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow the Create React App defaults with the bundled ESLint config (`react-app`, `react-app/jest`). Format JavaScript/JSX with two-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotesâ€”matching the existing files; enable Prettier in your editor if available. Name React components with PascalCase (`LandingPage`), hooks with the `use` prefix, and non-component helpers in camelCase. Keep Tailwind-first styling in JSX; when abstractions are needed, extend the utilities in `src/index.css` using `@layer` and `@apply`.

## Testing Guidelines
Jest with React Testing Library is already wired through `npm test`. Snapshot and DOM interaction tests belong alongside the component as `*.test.js`. Run `npm test -- --watchAll=false` before pushing to surface regressions in CI-like mode. Exercises that touch accessibility or animation timing should assert ARIA roles, keyboard paths, and rendered delays to match production UX.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Use short, imperative commit subjects that describe intent, e.g., `Polish navbar scroll behavior`; review the existing history for tone. Squash or amend noisy WIP commits before raising a PR. Every PR should include: a concise summary, linked issue (if any), notes on testing, and screenshots or clips when UI changes are visible. Ensure the branch rebases cleanly onto `main` and that `npm run build:with-images` succeeds locally before requesting review.

## Asset & Performance Notes
Place source imagery in `public/images` under logical folders (`team/`, `logos/`, `backgrounds/`). After adding assets, run `npm run optimize-images` to produce responsive variants and regenerate `src/config/imageManifest.json`; commit both the originals and generated outputs. Maintain placeholder naming (`*-placeholder.jpg`) so lazy-loading transitions remain smooth.
